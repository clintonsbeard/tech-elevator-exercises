/* Day 2: Has12
Create a boolean method called Has12 that takes in an integer array "nums".
Given an array of ints, return true if there is a 1 in the array with a 2 somewhere later in the array.

For example:
has12([1, 3, 2]) → true
has12([3, 1, 2]) → true
has12([3, 1, 4, 5, 2]) → true

(There are many possible solutions. Here is a challenge -  can you do this by looping through the array only once?)
(Already solved this problem? Too bad, solve it again. Better.) */
